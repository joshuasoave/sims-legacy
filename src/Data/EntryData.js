          The first week in The House of Fame has been nothing short of
          exhilarating! Cassandra's been hard at work, churning out paintings
          that have earned her a fame star. Nathaniel's been busy too,
          self-publishing his first series of novels and earning a star of his
          own. Gavin's been making waves in the music scene, and his hard work
          has paid off with a fame star.
        </p>

          Eloise has been busy too, but her focus has been on her appearance.
          She's gone on set to get into hair and makeup, and the results are
          stunning. Her new edgy look has earned her a fame star, and she's
          ready to take on the world. The competition's heating up, and the
          housemates are ready to give it their all. Who will be the first to
          reach five stars and claim the ultimate prize?
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately for Jasper and Sage, there will be an elimination round
          since a majority of the housemates have reached the same fame status.
          The sim with the lowest fame status will be eliminated. Who will it
          be? Stay tuned to find out!
