          premiere day arrives, and the contestants are primed for their
          journey. But as night falls, Cassandra stumbles upon Eloise and Sage's
          secret rendezvous. Seizing the moment, she immortalizes their affair
          in a scandalous painting, earning fame points aplenty. But trouble

          Eloise!
