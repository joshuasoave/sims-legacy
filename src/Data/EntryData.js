          The first week in The House of Fame has been nothing short of
          exhilarating! Cassandra's been hard at work, churning out paintings
          that have earned her a fame star. Nathaniel's been busy too,
          self-publishing his first series of novels and earning a star of his
          own. Gavin's been making waves in the music scene, and his hard work
          has paid off with a fame star.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eloise has been busy too, but her focus has been on her appearance.
          She's gone on set to get into hair and makeup, and the results are
          stunning. Her new edgy look has earned her a fame star, and she's
          ready to take on the world. The competition's heating up, and the
          housemates are ready to give it their all. Who will be the first to
          reach five stars and claim the ultimate prize?
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately for Jasper and Sage, there will be an elimination round
          since a majority of the housemates have reached the same fame status.
          The sim with the lowest fame status will be eliminated. Who will it
          be? Stay tuned to find out!

          The first elimination round has arrived, and the housemates are on
          edge. Gavin's been hard at work, streaming his guitar solo and earning
          a second star before the elimination ceremony. Jasper and Sage are
          both on the chopping block, and the tension is palpable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city lights shine behind the castmates as they sit together. Who
          will be eliminated from the competition? Jasper and Sage have both
          been streaming, but it all comes down to which of them has the most
          followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The results are in, and Jasper has more followers, saving him from
          elimination. Sage is eliminated from the competition, and he's not
          happy about it. He screams obscenities as he leaves the house, and the
          rest of the housemates are left to pick up the pieces. The competition
          is heating up, and the stakes have never been higher. Who will be the
          next to go, and who will claim the ultimate prize?
