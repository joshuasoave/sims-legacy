          Cassandra paints landscape paintings to gain fame points, while
          Nathaniel writes his path to victory. Gavin's belting out tunes, and
          Jasper's pumping iron. The second day arrives, and the contestants are
          primed for their journey. But as night falls, Cassandra stumbles upon
          Eloise and Sage's secret rendezvous in the creative circle. Seizing
          the moment, she immortalizes their affair in a scandalous painting,
          earning fame points aplenty. But trouble brews as Nathaniel learns the
          truth and delivers a fiery slap to Eloise!
