        With these Sims 4 Let's Play entries, I will be playing through various
        aspects of the game. Each challenge will have its own rules and goals.
        Please feel free to participate in the challenges yourself and share
        your progress. I would love to see how you play the game!

        The current Lets Play Challenge is called The Road to Fame. This
        challenge revolves around the Get Famous expansion pack. The goal is to
        become a 5 star celebrity. There will be various sims in the household,
        each with their own unique way of gaining fame. The first sim to reach 5
        stars wins.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rules are simple. The only cheats allowed are to move sims into the
        household. Each sim will have a unique career or method of gaining fame.
        One simstagram post is allowed each day. Quicks can be removed with the
        potion if the appropriate lifetime points are aquired. Sims all must
        live on the same lot. Romantic partners are allowed, even celebrities.
        No pets or children. The first sim to become a 5 star celebrity wins.
      </p>
      <p>
        The challenge will be played on a 64x64 lot in Del Sol Valley. The
        household will be given ยง20,000 to start. The household will consist of
        7 sims. The challenge will end when the first sim reaches 5 stars.
