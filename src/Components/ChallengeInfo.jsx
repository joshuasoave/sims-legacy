        With these Sims 4 Let's Play entries, I will be playing through various
        aspects of the game. Each challenge will have its own rules and goals.
        Please feel free to participate in the challenges yourself and share
        your progress. I would love to see how you play the game!

        The current Lets Play Challenge is called The Fame. This challenge
        revolves around the Get Famous expansion pack. The goal is to become a 5
        star celebrity and have a successful career in the acting field. I will
        be playing as Mack and will be sharing his story as he navigates the
        world of Del Sol Valley.
