        With these Sims 4 Let's Play entries, I will be playing through various
        aspects of the game. Each challenge will have its own rules and goals.
        Please feel free to participate in the challenges yourself and share
        your progress. I would love to see how you play the game!

        The current Lets Play Challenge is called The Road to Fame. This
        challenge revolves around the Get Famous expansion pack. The goal is to
        become a 5 star celebrity. There will be various sims in the household,
        each with their own unique way of gaining fame. The first sim to reach 5
        stars wins.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rules are simple. The first sim to become a 5 star celebrity wins.
        Each sim will have a unique career or skill. One simstagram post is
        allowed each day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sims will be eliminated if a majority of the sims have reached the same
        fame status. The sim with the lowest fame status will be eliminated. If
        two sims have the same fame status for elimination, the sim with the
        lowest followers will be eliminated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow along with the challenge and see who will be the first to reach 5
        stars and claim the ultimate prize!
